### UK airspace for gliding

I am the current maintainer of the UK airspace files used by moving map
software such as SeeYou and XCSoar.

The airspace data can be downloaded from the [ASSelect](https://asselect.uk/)
website in either Openair or TNP formats. The data can be imported directly
into XCSoar and LK8000. Users of LX products will have convert the data into
CUB format using SeeYou.

The airspace database itself is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahsparrow/airspace).
It is updated every four weeks in synchroniation with the UK AIP.
