Graphical NOTAM software for the UK

NavPlot is a program to download and format low level (less than FL100)
En-route and Navigation Warning Notams from the Eurocontrol
[EAD Basic](http://www.ead.eurocontrol.int/). The software creates a PDF
file to display a map of Notams in a format suitable for glider pilots on
thermal cross country flights. You can see an
[example here]({{site-url}}/assets/navplot/navplot_example.pdf)

## News

**3 December 14** - EAD have changed their server configuration.
Old versions of Navplot no longer work. Please upgrade to the latest version.

## Download

For Windows users there is a
[setup program]({{site-url}}/assets/navplot/setup.exe)
that will install NavPlot to your machine and provide a simple GUI for you to
select and display the NOTAMS.

* [Download setup.exe]({{site-url}}/assets/navplot/setup.exe)

The software has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows XP.

## Using the software

Before using NavPlot you must register with the Eurocontrol
[EAD Basic](http://www.ead.eurocontrol.int/) website to
get a username and password. (You must also agree to Eurocontrol's
terms and conditions.) Your username and password should be entered
on the Settings tab of the program.

**IMPORTANT - From the EAD Basic home page select the
"My Profile/Password" option and make sure Application Access mode
is set to "Simple Mode - plain HTML".**

**Eurocontrol have a stupid password aging policy. Every year
your password expires and must be reset. If you get an error message
telling you to check your password try logging in directly to the
[EAD Basic](http://www.ead.eurocontrol.int/publicuser/public/pu/login.jsp)
website**

By default the software plots a map suitable for use in the Midlands
and South East England. Other areas of the country can be plotted by
changing the map coordinates in the Settings tab.  The coordinates
set the lower left corner of the map and its width.

NavPlot is not meant to replace an official briefing - it
should only be used as an aid to interpretion. If you go somewhere
you shouldn't have gone after using this software don't blame me!
