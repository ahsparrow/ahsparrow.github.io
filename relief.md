## Introduction

Systems seem to fall into three categories, broadly describable as
[nappies](#nappies), [external-funnels](#external-funnels) and
[internal](#internal-fitments). All three types have convinced users. I
flew without plumbing for many years - but have become totally convinced that
it's much better with than without. Following a discussion on this at the
Bicester development day several people sent information, and I append it
below.

To prevent spamming I've altered the email addresses slightly - to
reconstruct them take out the spaces, replace dot with '.' and use the normal
@ sign. If you have an alternative or any feedback let me know at
ebertoya at iee dot org.

## Nappies

Kay Draper writes: For those interested in the "personal hygiene" matters we
discussed at Bicester. I have been speaking to
[Attends](http://www.attends.co.uk) who have sent me some samples of
their new products. I will bring them along to Lash if we get together so you
can see them before I give them a trial. They also now produce an insert pad
called the Deoplus (for those long flights) and an under sheet called the
Cover-Dri, which I think she said was washable, to protect your seat. Looking at
it I'm not sure how slippery it would be so will try it out to assess the risk
of submarining in the seat.

Liz adds: Kay convinced me to try Attends after years of flying with no
plumbing; I now use them and so far have found them reliable. They are
*not* the same as the ones you buy in most chemists - they are
much, much more absorbent. They are comfortable to wear and are made with a gel
that absorbs the liquid and so remain dry in use. It is prudent to take a change
of trousers/knickers in case of accidents but I have not had to use that
yet.

## External Funnels

### Stadium Gal

Claudia Buengen suggests: One option (which was recommended to me by a bloke,
so I have no idea whether the female version actually works) was the ["stadium
gal"](http://www.stadiumpal.com/store/stadiumgal.html). I'm not sure this is
available in the UK.

### The Whiz

See [www.whizaway.com](http://www.whizaway.com) Kay and Liz will be
trying and reporting back on this flexible funnel arrangement. Claims to 
be used by glider pilots already.

### Instructions for making and using a simple female pee-device

Diana King described a funnel arrangement that she has used successfully for
many years. I picked up this idea from Annie Laylee, it has revolutionised my
long flights. For years I wore terry towelling nappies and plastic pants and
thought I had the problem solved, even though uncomfortably. Now I have my
pee-tube I would not go back to nappies for anything! The only way in which the
old system is better is that having a pee in nappies is simply a matter of
letting go, whereas the tube system needs a bit more attention. In every other
way the tube is vastly better. Practise using it one-handed on the ground
before you try it for real. Don't forget to go on flying the glider and looking
out while you're busy!

The first thing to say is that this is a very simple, low-tech, system. My
philosophy is that the simpler the arrangement is, the less there is to go
wrong! The basic kit is an oval shape shampoo or shower gel bottle. There are
two alternative arrangements, one for gliders with a built in pee-tube, and one
to work with plastic bags.

#### Plastic Bag method

Cut most of the
base out of the bottle leaving a bit of a rim to give the "funnel" some
rigidity. Cut off the top of the bottle, leaving it about 4 inches long and
shape it in a nice curve to fit you. You may need some trial and error to get
this bit right, so cut off the minimum initially. In order to make the cut off
end of the bottle more comfortable, we experimented with split tubing fitted
round the plastic to cushion the edges, but this tended to leak. For the short
time you will use the device, the cut off plastic edge is not too uncomfortable
if smoothed off well. Firmly tape a medium size freezer bag around the bottom
end of the bottle, leaving a tag of tape to make it easier to pull the tape
off after use. Freezer bags are less likely to split or puncture than ordinary
plastic bags.

Note that the top end of the funnel should be curved to fit, not cut
straight across.
