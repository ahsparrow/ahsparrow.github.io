* What information is collected?

    * Bell Finder can record details of your tower visits.

    * Bell Finder uses your location information to find the towers
    closest to your current location and to display your position on a map.

* How is the information used?

    * Tower visits are stored locally on your device and are only
    used by the Bell Finder app itself to display details of your previous
    tower visits.

    * Location is used by Bell Finder to download map tiles
    to display a map of the area surrounding your location. Your actual
    location is not shared.

* What information is shared?

    * No information is shared with either Bell Finder's developer or
    any other third party.
