* What information is collected?

    * Bell Finder can record details of your tower visits.

    * Bell Finder uses your device's location.

* How is the information used?

    * Tower visits are stored locally on your device and are only
    used by the Bell Finder app itself to display details of previous
    tower visits.

    * Your location is used by Bell Finder to query a local database of bell
    tower posititions, and can also be used to download map tiles to build a
    map of the area surrounding your location. Your actual location is not
    shared.

* What information is shared?

    * No information is shared with either Bell Finder's developer or
    any other party.
