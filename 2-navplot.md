### Graphical NOTAM software for the UK.

The old standalone Windows Navplot program has been retired. Instead
pre-generate briefings for the next two days can be downloaded from the
[ASSelect](https://asselect.uk) web site.

Note - NavPlot is not meant to replace an official briefing - it
should only be used as an aid to interpretion. Don't blame me if you go
somewhere you shouldn't have gone after using this software!
